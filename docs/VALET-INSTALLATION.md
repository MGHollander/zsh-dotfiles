## Install Laravel Valet

Follow the installation steps on <https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet#installation>.

## Install MailHog

Run `brew install mailhog` on your command line. Once MailHog has been installed, you may start it using `brew services start mailhog`.

Now you can access MailHog via <http://localhost:8025/> or <http://127.0.0.1:8025/>.

Run `valet proxy mailhog http://127.0.0.1:8025` to access MailHog via <http://mailhog.test/>.

### Configure PHP to send mail to MailHog

Run `php --ini` to see which ini files PHP is using and copy the path in which additional .ini files are saved.

Run `/usr/local/etc/php/X.X/conf.d/mailhog.ini` and add the config below (replace the X.X with you PHP version or change the path if it does not match the result from above's command).

```ini
; Use mailhog for sending emails
sendmail_path = /usr/local/bin/MailHog sendmail test@test
```

You need to repeat these steps every time you switch to a PHP version you have not been using before.

Finally run `valet restart` to activate the

## Install Xdebug

Run `pecl channel-update pecl.php.net` to prepare PECL.

Run `pecl install xdebug` to install Xdebug.
The Xdebug installation returns a path to `xdebug.so` when it has finished installing. This looks something like

```txt
Build process completed successfully
Installing '/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.4.9/pecl/20190902/xdebug.so'
install ok: channel://pecl.php.net/xdebug-2.9.6
Extension xdebug enabled in php.ini
```

Remember the path after **Installing**.

Run `php -m | grep 'xdebug'` to verify if Xdebug was installed. The output should be `xdebug`.

Run `php --ini` to see which ini files PHP is using and copy the path in which additional .ini files are saved.

Run `vi /usr/local/etc/php/X.X/conf.d/ext-xdebug.ini` and add the config below (replace the X.X with you PHP version or change the path if it does not match the result from above's command).

```ini
[xdebug]
zend_extension="/path/to/xdebug.so"
xdebug.remote_autostart=1
xdebug.default_enable=1
xdebug.remote_port=9000
xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.remote_connect_back=1
xdebug.remote_enable=1
xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM
```

Replace `/path/to` in the `zend_extension` value with the path the Xdebug installation returned.

Edit you php.ini file and remove `zend_extension="xdebug.so"`. This rule is probably added to the top of the file.

Finally run `valet restart`.

You need to repeat these steps every time you switch to a PHP version you have not been using before.

**Note:** This has been tested with PHP 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4. Instructions might be different for other PHP versions.

### Configure PHPStorm

Next step is to configure PHPStorm. Open PHPStorm and open the preference panel. Go to `Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Debug > DBGp Proxy` and set IDE key to `PHPSTORM`. Next, set Port to `9000`.

After that, go to `Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Debug` and set Xdebug port to `9000`, check Can accept external connections and clear the two Force break at first lineâ€¦ checkboxes.

Now, you can save the settings and click Start listening for PHP Debug Connections and your debugger should be up and running.

## Install Memcached

Run `brew install libmemcached` to install Memcached on your machine if you haven't yet. You might also need to run `brew install pkg-config`.

Run `pecl channel-update pecl.php.net` to prepare PECL.

Run `pecl install memcached` to install Memcached.
The Xdebug installation returns a path to `memcached.so` when it has finished installing. This looks something like

```txt
Build process completed successfully
Installing '/usr/local/Cellar/php@7.2/7.2.34_4/pecl/20170718/memcached.so'
install ok: channel://pecl.php.net/memcached-3.1.5
Extension memcached enabled in php.ini
```

Remember the path after **Installing**.

Run `php -m | grep 'memcached'` to verify if Memcached was installed. The output should be `memcached`.

Run `php --ini` to see which ini files PHP is using and copy the path in which additional .ini files are saved.

Run `vi /usr/local/etc/php/X.X/conf.d/ext-memcached.ini` and add the config below (replace the X.X with you PHP version or change the path if it does not match the result from above's command).

```ini
[memcached]
extension=/path/to/memcached.so
```

Replace `/path/to` in the `extension` value with the path the Memcached installation returned.

Edit you php.ini file and remove `extension="memcached.so"`. This rule is probably added to the top of the file.

Finally run `valet restart`.

You need to repeat these steps every time you switch to a PHP version you have not been using before.

**Note:** This has been tested with PHP 7.3. Instructions might be different for other PHP versions.
