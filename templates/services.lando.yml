# This example can be used to setup services.
# Create a .lando folder an copy this file in it. Then rename this file to .lando.yml.
# Run the services from the .lando folder.
# The .lando folder is part of the global ignore and therefore should never be picked up by Git. But always double check yourself :-).
# @TODO add this to the readme as proper documentation...
